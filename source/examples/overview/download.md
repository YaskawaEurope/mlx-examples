Below links offer downloads of our ports of the Mce library items.
As these are still a work in progress, we cannot yet ship them as a
versioned library.

Instead, for each PLC platform we include the date in the package name, and
include a file called `_version-info.txt`, which provides information on the
included library items (data type, function block etc.) and their versions.
