      *Used as input*
      
      Specifies the motion device targeted by this function.

      This parameter works the same way as the `RobotNumber` parameter used in
      many functions of the MotoLogix library.
    type: SINT
    default_value: "0"

      *Used as input*

      Specifies the `RobotNumber` of the optional external axis.

      This parameter works the same way as the `RobotNumber` parameter used in
      many functions of the MotoLogix library.

  - name: bSystemReady
    description: |
      *Used as input*

      Condition to enable *PosTable*.
      It should be `True` only when the system is in the *Servo ON* state.

      Should be linked directly to the [`bSystemReady`](../mcestartstopio/#bsystemready)
      output of an [`MceStartStopIO`](../mcestartstopio) instance.
