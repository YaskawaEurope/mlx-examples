      *Used as input*

      Set to `True` if `McePosTable` is controlled by an higher-level process.
      Set to `False` if it is controlled manually.
    type: BOOL
    comment: "input: true if PosTable is controller by an higher-level process. False if PosTable is controlled directly by a user"
  - name: bStep
    description: |
      *Used as input*

      Trigger for transition steps.

      `PosTable` perform the next motion (or actionID) if `nPosTableMode = 2`.

      Also used by `ACTIONID_WAIT_STEPBUTTON`.

      Only available if `bHigherLevelControlled` is false.
    type: BOOL
    comment: "input: trigger (e.g. pushbutton) for transition step. Only available if `bHigherLevelControlled` is false"
  - name: bCmdEnable
    description: |
      *Used as input*

      Command to enable the *PosTable*.

      When `False`, PosTable is reset.
    type: BOOL
    comment: "input: command to Enable PosTable motions. Reset PosTable if FALSE"
  - name: bCmdRun
    description: |
      *Used as input*

      Command to run the *PosTable*.

      When `False`, PosTable is paused and motions are n,ot queued.
      Note that the robot may continue its trajectory up to the latest loaded point.
      Setting back to `True` resume the trajectory.

      Only available if `bHigherLevelControlled` is true.
