      *Used as input*

      Run the PosTable trajectory.

      In a normal scenario, `bRun` needs to stay `True` until PosTable has
      completed (`bDone`).

      Setting `bRun` to `False` will reset the PosTable:
      - [`nIndex`](#nindex) and [`nLoadIndex`](#nloadindex) are set to `0`
      - [`nCycleNr`](#ncyclenr) is reset
      - [`bError`](#berror) is reset

      If `bRun` is set to `False` while the PosTable hasn't finished yet, 
      it will abort PosTable and then reset.
      The abort behavior is defined by [`nAbortingMode`](#nabortingmode).

  - name: bStep
    description: |
      Trigger next step. This is typically required when running PosTable
      step-by-step.

      The user is informed by the [`bWaitForStep`](#bwaitforstep) output.

  - name: bRecalcQA
    description: |
      *Used as input*

      Manual trigger to recalculate the "queueing amount" (QA).

      A use case is if an **ActionID** was removed while PosTable is running.
      By executing a `RecalcQA` it will prevent a short standstill of the robot at
      the entry where the action was removed.
    type: BOOL
    comment: "input: recalculate QA (queueing amount)"
  - name: nAbortingMode
    description: |
      *Used as input*

      Select how the PosTable will be aborted when [`bRun`](#brun)
      becomes `False` while PosTable was still running.

    default_value: "0"
    comment: "input: select aborting mode [0=controlled stop, 1=immediate reset of PosTable]"
    legend:
      "0" : |
        Controlled stop until standstill. It gently waits until the already
        buffered motions have finished. This is the prefered way.
      "1" : |
        Immediately reset PosTable. This breaks the active motion commands and
        can result in dangling commands in the MotoLogix command buffer.
        It would require an MLxReset to clean up things afterwards.
  - name: nMode
    description: |
      *Used as input*

      Specifies the PosTable operation mode.

      A PosTable trajectory would normally be executed using motion blending,
      resulting in a fast and smooth trajectory.
      But sometimes (e.g. for testing purposes) you might want to run it without
      blending or even step-by-step.
      That is possible by setting the corresponding mode.

      Changing mode from blending to another mode will first finish the
      already buffered motions before the new mode is visible.
      This effect can be seen as synchronizing `nIndex` to `nLoadIndex`.
    type: SINT
    default_value: "0"

      "2" : "Single motion (wait for step after each motion)"
  - name: nNrOfCycles
    description: |
      *Used as input*

      Specifies number of cycles for the PosTable.

      A PosTable trajectory would normally be executed just once.
      But sometimes you might want to run it a specific number of cycles, or
      even endless.

    default_value: "1"

  - name: aConditions
    description: |
      Each `aCondition` bit can reflect the state of a sensor or the result of
      a more complex boolean operation.

      If one or several `aStartCondition` are used in a entry of PosTable,
      the corresponding `aCondition` bit will be used to authorize the motion.

  - name: bCustomActionDone
    description: |
      *Used as input*

      If you are using custom actions then this is the handshake signal
      to tell PosTable that your custom action has finished.
      After this signal, PosTable will continue the trajectory.
    type: BOOL
    comment: "input: custom action at standstill done"
  - name: bActionStart
    description: |
      *Used as output*

      State that the robot is in standstill and an `ActionID` is in process.

      If you are using custom actions then this is the trigger to start your action.
    type: BOOL
    comment: "output: start action at standstill"
  - name: nActionID
    description: |
      *Used as output*

      Current ActionID number, used as interface for running custom actions
      which you program yourself outside of `McePosTable`.

  - name: aMissingConditions
    description: |
      Conditions preventing the trajectory to continue.
      Check the corresponding `aConditions` to know which input has paused the
      trajectory.

      If all conditions are satisfied or if no conditions are used, all bits are set to
      `False`.
