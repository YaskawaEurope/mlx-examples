      *Used as input*
      
      Specifies the motion device targeted by this function.

      The MotoLogix system supports a maximum of **4 motion devices** on one
      robot controller.
      Examples of motion devices are:
      - **manipulators** (e.g. GP7 robot)
      - **base axis** (e.g. gantry system)
      - **station axis** (e.g. servo gripper)

      Each motion device gets its own `RobotNumber`. For example with 2 robots:
      ```iecst
      [0]   // R1
      [1]   // R2
      [2]   // not used
      [3]   // not used
      ```
    type: SINT
    default_value: "0"

      Used as an input to point the robot number of the external axis.

  - name: bSystemReady
    description: |
      Used as an input.
      *PosTable* is enabled using this input.

      Should be linked directly to the [`bSystemReady`](#bsystemready) output of an
      `ExtStartStopIO` instance.
    type: BOOL
    comment: "input: System ready for operation"
  - name: bStep
    description: |
      Used as a trigger for transition steps.

      `PosTable` perform the next motion (or actionID) if `nPosTableMode = 2`.

      Also used by `ACTIONID_WAIT_STEPBUTTON`.
    type: BOOL
    comment: "input: trigger (e.g. pushbutton) for transition step"

  - name: nPosTableMode
    description: |
      Used as an input to select the PosTable operation mode.
    type: SINT
    default_value: "0"

      "1" : "Single cycle"
      ">1" : "`n` cycles"
  - name: nSpeedManipulation
    description: |
      Used as an input to set a speed factor to the following motions.
    type: REAL
    default_value: "10"
