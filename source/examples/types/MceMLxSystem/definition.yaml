      Latency of the communication between the robot controller and the PLC.

      The time is given in `ms`.

      while a value greater than `1000ms` triggers the `MLxCommunicationRead`
      watchdog.

  - name: nCommandInUse
    description: |
      Number of slots in the command buffer currently in use.

      The value is usually close to `0` (no command currently in used).
      A constant value greater than `0` means that one or more function block
      has been disabled before returning the `Sts_DN` signal.

      The maximum value is `25`.
