    description: |
      Target position for this motion.

      The values unit depends on the [`TargetType`](#targettype) parameter :
      - `degrees` if it is an *Axis position*
      - `mm` and `degrees` if it is a *TCP position*
    type: ARRAY[0..5]OF REAL
    comment: axis positions [deg] for TargetType=0 / TCP position (X, Y, Z, Rx, Ry, Rz) for TargetType=1

    description: |
      Target position of the optional external axis.
    type: ARRAY[0..0]OF REAL
    comment: external (station) axis positions
  - name: Speed
    description: |
      Specifies the speed of the motion.

      The speed unit depends on the [`SpeedUnits`](#speedunits) parameter.

  - name: SpeedExtAxis
    description: |
      Specifies the speed of the motion to the optional external axis.

      If `=0` then the external axis motion is disabled.
    type: REAL
    comment: "[% from max], if =0 external axis motion is disabled"
  - name: SpeedUnits
