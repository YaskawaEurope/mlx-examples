    description: |
      Specifies how the speed setting for the robot motion should be interpreted.
    type: BOOL
    comment: 0=speed is set for the linear part of the motion, 1=speed is set for the rotational part of the motion

  - name: aPosition
    description: |
      Target position for this motion.

      The values unit depends on the [`TargetType`](#targettype) parameter :
      - `degrees` if it is an *Axis position*
      - `mm` and `degrees` if it is a *TCP position*
    type: ARRAY[0..5]OF REAL
    comment: axis positions [deg] for TargetType=0 / TCP position (X, Y, Z, Rx, Ry, Rz) for TargetType=1
  - name: fSpeed
    description: |
      Specifies the speed of the motion.

      The speed unit depends on the [`SpeedUnits`](#speedunits) parameter.
    type: REAL
    comment: "[% from max] for SpeedUnits=0 / [absolute units (mm/sec and deg/sec)] for SpeedUnits=1 / [50-100% from VMAX] for SpeedUnits=2 (n/a for DX200)"
  - name: nSpeedUnits
    description: |
      Specifies the speed unit of the [`Speed`](#speed) parameter.
