var:
  - name: bEnable
    description: |
      *Used as input*

      Condition to enable [`PickPlace`](../../functions/pickplace).

      The application is started when this parameter is set to `True`.

      Disable this parameter to abort production.
    type: BOOL
    comment: "input: enable production"

  - name: bHold
    description: |
      *Used as input*

      Hold the robot in pick or place position while this signal is `True`.

      When a *hold* is requested while the robot is moving, the `MceStartStop`
      pause the trajectory.
      But if the *hold* is requested while the robot is not moving (like doing
      an action with the gripper), the `MceStartStop` cannot pause the trajectory
      since motion commands are being sent.
      This signal is used to *hold* the state machine in the pick or place state.
    type: BOOL

  # - name: bStopRequest
  #   description: |
  #     *Used as input*

  #     Request a stop of the pick/place cycle.
  #     The robot ends the current cycle and goes to home position.

  #     [`bEnding`](#bending) output is `True` when the cycle is coming to an end.
  #   type: BOOL

      *Used as input*

      Select the start position for the trajectory.
      The trajectory depends on the `nStartPosition` and the
      [`nTargetPosition`](../mcestartstopio/#ntargetposition) inputs.

      *Used as input*

      Select the target position for the trajectory.
      The trajectory depends on the [`nStartPosition`](../mcestartstopio/#nstartposition)
      and the nTargetPosition inputs.

  - name: bServoOn
    description: |
      *Used as input*

      It should be `True` only when the system is in the *Servo ON* state.

      Should be linked directly to the [`bServoOn`](../mcestartstopio/#bservoon)

  - name: bPosTableBusy
    description: |
      *Used as input*

      Controlled `McePosTable` is in *Busy* state and running the trajectory.
