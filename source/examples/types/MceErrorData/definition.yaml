      This dynamic text helps to pinpoint the cause of the alarm.

      Example:

      - `[R1:MAX S] TASK#0`

      This tells that the pulse limit alarm applies to the *S-axis* in
      *positive* direction, of the *first robot*.

      - `2022/02/16 14:58:32`

    type: STRING[19]
    comment: "date of occurrence [yyyy/mm/dd HH:mm:ss]"
