      *Used as input*

      Specifies the number of the MotoLogix system mapped to this function.

      This input is monitored for changes
      (will reset the state machine and send user frame and tool settings on
      the next jog command).

      *Used as input*

      In inching mode a rising edge of a jog input leads to just a
      single relative motion command with a very short travel distance.
      This is useful for the last really fine jog motions in scenarios
      where highest precision is required such as defining a user frame.

      | Jog type                            | Travel distance |
      | ----------------------------------- | --------------- |
      | axis (`S/L/U/R/B/T`)                | 0.1 deg         |
      | cartesian, translational  (`X/Y/Z`) | 0.1 mm          |
      | cartesian, rotational  (`Rx/Ry/Rz`) | 0.1 deg         |
