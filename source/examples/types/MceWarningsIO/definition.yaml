      *Used as output*

      This one-shot signal fires every time a full polling cycle has completed.
      It can be useful for further processing of the warning data
      (e.g. scrolling on HMI).

      *Used as output*

      This tells how many warnings are active.

  - name: tPollInterval
    description: |
      Minimum interval for polling robot warnings.

      The following rules apply:
      - Set this time to *at least two times your plc scan time*
      - Don't use a setting lower than `50ms`

      In certain `SytemStates` this interval will be multiplied by five.
      This will free up communication resources and lead to faster response
      times for more important commands such as motions.

    type: TIME
    default_value: "T#100ms"
