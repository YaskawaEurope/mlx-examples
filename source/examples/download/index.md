These latest generation MotoLogix example projects are built on the Mce functions.
Our goal is to provide ready to use PLC projects, including HMI (where possible).
It is an ongoing development, and other PLC platforms will be added over time.


**Versioning**

We currently don't use versioning at project level.
Instead, we include the date in the package name, and
include a file called `_version-info.txt`, which provides version information
on the included Mce library items (data type, function block etc.).
