          The *Queueing Amount* is the number of motions allowed to be queued.

          Queueing motion in advance is necessary for smooth motion.

        description: |
          Index of the last pre-loaded motion.
          
          It is calculated as follow:

          ```iecst
          LoadIndex := Index + QA;
