  conditions:
    description: |
      Bits used as start conditions for a PosTable entry.
      
      If a PosTable entry has one or more bits in `startConditions` set to `TRUE`
      then the motion for that entry will not be started until the start conditions
      are satisfied.

      - Conditions are only checked for the `TRUE` state
      - If you need a condition to be checked for the `FALSE` state, 
        you need to invert the connected signal outside of PosTable
