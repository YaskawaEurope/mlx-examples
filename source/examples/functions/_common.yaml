  QA:
    description: |
      Queueing Amount.
      This is the amount of motions which will be send in advance.
      For blending the robot controller needs to have three motions in its
      motion queue; the active motion + two in advance.

      Therefore the QA is usually `2`.
      When planning a standstill the QA will be reduced till zero.

      The QA is used as condition for pre-sending the next motions:

      ```iecst
      //start this motion
      moveCmd[0].Enable := TRUE;

      //queue next 2 motions
      moveCmd[1].Enable := (moveCmd[0].Sts_EN AND moveCmd[0].Sts_DN) AND (QA >= 1);
      moveCmd[2].Enable := (moveCmd[1].Sts_EN AND moveCmd[1].Sts_DN) AND (QA >= 2);
      ```
    type: DINT
