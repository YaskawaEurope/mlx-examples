  nQa:
    description: |
      Queueing amount.
      This is the amount of pre-sent motions.

      For motion blending the robot controller needs to have three motions in its
      motion queue: the active motion + two in advance.

      Therefore the QA is usually `2`.
      When planning a standstill the QA will be reduced till zero.

      The QA is used as condition for pre-sending the next motions:

      ```iecst
      //start this motion
      fbMove[0].Enable := TRUE;

      //queue next 2 motions
      fbMove[1].Enable := (fbMove[0].Sts_EN AND fbMove[0].Sts_DN) AND (QA >= 1);
      fbMove[2].Enable := (fbMove[1].Sts_EN AND fbMove[1].Sts_DN) AND (QA >= 2);
      ```
